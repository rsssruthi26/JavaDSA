Lets see 

# Arrays:

An array is an indexed collection of fixed number of homogenous data elements. 

### Advantages:

We can store multiple values with single variable. 

### Disadvantages:

1. Array are fixed in size.
2. They store only homogenous elements.
3. They don’t have any underlying data structure, so we don’t have any ready methods. 

# Why collections:

### Advantages:

1. Collections are dynamic in size.
2. They store both homogenous and heterogenous elements.
3. They have underlying data structures, so we have ready made methods to use for programming.

## Differences between Arrays and Collections:

| Arrays | Collections |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed in size | Growable in size |
| not good wrt to memory | Good wrt memory |
| wrt performance its good | wrt performance its not that good
compared to arrays |
| stores only homogenous | stores both homogenous and 
heterogenous. |
| Underlying data structure is 
not there, so no underlying methds | Built with standard datastructures, so we have ready made methods to use |
| Can hold primitives and objects  data types | Can hold only object data type |
